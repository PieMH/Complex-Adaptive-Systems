# Complex Adaptive Systems
### Description
This is a simple computational model for Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS).

CAS are typically living [Complex Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system#:~:text=Complex%20systems%20are%20systems%20whose%20behavior%20is%20intrinsically,or%20between%20a%20given%20system%20and%20its%20environment.).

If you understand italian you can read [Thesis.pdf]() where I explain the theory behind this work.

The system we modelled is a CASS (A social CAS) that simulate an [ant colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant).

### Build and Run
Build the src folder with a jdk from java 8 onward. Works the best if imported in IntelliJ.

Run the simulation by running "Launcher.java".

### How to
In the Options Menu you can select to visualize either the full simulation or the GOL one, which stands for [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
